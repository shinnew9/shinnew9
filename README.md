## 👋 Hi, I’m Yoojin Shin
I’m an AI Engineer & Data Scientist with a background that bridges Computer Science, Psychology, and Communication.
Currently, I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at Lehigh University, where I work on LLM-based systems and multimodal AI with a focus on human-centered intelligence.
I’m particularly interested in how language, cognition, and decision-making are reflected in data—and how we can build AI systems that align with the way humans actually think and communicate.



## 🔍 What I Work On
🤖 LLM-based AI Agents <br>
Designing and evaluating therapist-style AI systems that provide structured feedback and skill metrics for novice counselors.

🧠 NLP & Multimodal Learning <br>
Natural language processing, representation learning, and joint modeling of text, audio, and visual signals.

📊 Applied Machine Learning <br>
Customer satisfaction prediction, candidate ranking, segmentation, and data-driven decision systems using real-world industry data.

🧩 Human-Centered AI <br>
Projects informed by psychology and communication theory, aiming for interpretability, alignment, and real impact.


## 🛠 Tech Stack 
- Languages: Python, SQL, Java, R
- ML / DL: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NLP libraries
- Data & Infra: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Spark, Docker
- Research Tools: Experimentation, model evaluation, visualization, technical writing



## 🌱 Background Snapshot
🎓 MS in Computer Science — Lehigh University <br> 
🎓 MS in Computer Science — Hanyang University <br>
🎓 BA in Psychology & Communication — University of Utah <br>

I’ve worked across academia, industry, and research labs, and I enjoy translating complex ideas into systems people can actually use.



## ✨ Outside of Code
I enjoy thinking deeply, writing ML notes, taking photos ☕📸, and exploring ideas like “How do humans make sense of the world—and how should AI learn from that?”
